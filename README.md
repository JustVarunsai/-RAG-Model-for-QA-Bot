# RAG-Model-for-QA-Bot
The name highlights the core functionalities: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Pinecone for efficient document embedding storage and retrieval, alongside OpenAIâ€™s GPT model for answer generation

Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model using OpenAI and Pinecone to answer business-related queries.
Utilized Python for backend development, implementing features for document retrieval and embedding generation.
Enhanced model accuracy through iterative dataset refinement and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques.
